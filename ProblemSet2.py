# # Problem 1
# Write one _for_ loop to print out each character of the string *my_str* on a separate line. 

# %%
my_str = "MICHIGAN"

# Write your code below.
for char in my_str:
    print(char)

# %% [markdown]
# # Problem 2
# In the cell below where indicated, do the following:
# 1. Write one _for_ loop to print out each element of the list *several_things*. 
# 2. Write another _for_ loop to print out the _type_ of each element of the list *several_things*. 

# %%

# # Problem 3
# Write code that uses iteration to print on a separate line the length of each element of the list *str_list*. 

# %%
str_list = ["hello", "", "goodbye", "wonderful", "I love Python"]

# Write your code below.
for length in str_list:
    print(len(length))

# %% [markdown]
# # Problem 4
# Write code to count the number of characters in the string *original_str* using the accumulation pattern. Assign the answer to a variable num_chars. Print the variable num_chars.
# 
# Do NOT use the len function to solve the problem.  You may use the len function on the string to confirm the your answer is correct. 

# %%

# Write your code below.
num_chars = 0

# %% [markdown]
# # Problem 5
# Write code to create a list of word lengths for the words in *original_str* using the accumulation pattern and assign the answer to a variable num_words_list. You need to use the len function to determine the lenght of each word. Print the list created. 

# %%

# # Problem 6
# The string *addition_str* contains list of numbers separated by the plus sign. Write code that uses the accumulation pattern to take the sum of all of the numbers and assigns it to sum_val (an integer).  Print the variable sum_val. 
# 
# You should use the split function to split by "+" and int() to cast to an integer.

# %%
addition_str = "2+5+10+20"

# Write your code below.

# %% [markdown]
# # Problem 7
# The string *week_temps_f* contains a list of fahrenheit temperatures separated by the comma.  Write code that uses the accumulation pattern to compute the average temperature and assign it to the variable *avg_temp*. Do not hard code your answer.  This means that your code must compute both the total of all temperatures and the number of temperatures in week_temps_f.  Print the variable avg_temp.
# 
# You need to use the *split* function to split by "," and float() to cast to a float. 

# %%
week_temps_f = "75.1,77.7,83.2,82.5,81.0,79.5,85.7"

# Write your code below.

# # Problem 8
# Write a program that uses the turtle module and a _for_ loop to draw something.  It doesnâ€™t have to be complicated, but draw something different than we did in the textbook or in class.  Hint: if you are drawing something complicated, try setting .speed(10) for the turtle to draw fast or .speed(0) to draw super fast.
# 
# This version of Turtle is missing a couple of properties and methods as described in the online textbook.  

# %%
from mobilechelonian import Turtle

# Write your code below.
turt = Turtle()
for idx in range(0, 25):
    turt.left(45)
    turt.forward(idx)
